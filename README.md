What does `UNION` do? What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?

View the answer →Hide answer


`UNION` merges the contents of two structurally-compatible tables into a single combined table. The difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` is that `UNION` will omit duplicate records whereas `UNION ALL` will include duplicate records.

It is important to note that the performance of `UNION ALL` will typically be better than `UNION`, since `UNION` requires the server to do the additional work of removing any duplicates. So, in cases where is is certain that there will not be any duplicates, or where having duplicates is not a problem, use of `UNION ALL` would be recommended for performance reasons.


List and explain the different types of `JOIN` clauses supported in ANSI-standard SQL.

View the answer →Hide answer


ANSI-standard SQL specifies five types of `JOIN` clauses as follows:

*   `INNER JOIN` (a.k.a. “simple join”): Returns all rows for which there is at least one match in BOTH tables. _This is the default type of join if no specific `JOIN` type is specified._
    
*   `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table; i.e., the results will contain _all_ records from the left table, even if the `JOIN` condition doesn’t find any matching records in the right table. This means that if the `ON` clause doesn’t match any records in the right table, the `JOIN` will still return a row in the result for that record in the left table, but with NULL in each column from the right table.
    
*   `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. This is the exact opposite of a `LEFT JOIN`; i.e., the results will contain _all_ records from the right table, even if the `JOIN` condition doesn’t find any matching records in the left table. This means that if the `ON` clause doesn’t match any records in the left table, the `JOIN` will still return a row in the result for that record in the right table, but with NULL in each column from the left table.
    
*   `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`): Returns all rows for which there is a match in EITHER of the tables. Conceptually, a `FULL JOIN` combines the effect of applying both a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`; i.e., its result set is equivalent to performing a `UNION` of the results of left and right outer queries.
    
*   `CROSS JOIN`: Returns all records where each row from the first table is combined with each row from the second table (i.e., returns the Cartesian product of the sets of rows from the joined tables). Note that a `CROSS JOIN` can either be specified using the `CROSS JOIN` syntax (“explicit join notation”) or (b) listing the tables in the `FROM` clause separated by commas without using a `WHERE` clause to supply join criteria (“implicit join notation”).
    


For a table `orders` having a column defined simply as `customer_id VARCHAR(100)`, consider the following two query results:

    SELECT count(*) AS total FROM orders;
    

    +-------+
    | total |
    +-------+
    |  100  |
    +-------+
    

    SELECT count(*) AS cust_123_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = '123';
    

    +----------------+
    | cust_123_total |
    +----------------+
    |       15       |
    +----------------+
    

Given the above query results, what will be the result of the query below?

    SELECT count(*) AS cust_not_123_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id <> '123';
    

View the answer →Hide answer


The obvious answer is 85 (i.e, 100 - 15). However, that is not necessarily correct. Specifically, any records with a `customer_id` of `NULL` will _not_ be included in _either_ count (i.e., they won’t be included in `cust_123_total`, nor will they be included in `cust_not_123_total`). For example, if exactly one of the 100 customers has a `NULL` `customer_id`, the result of the last query will be:

    +--------- ----------+
    | cust_not_123_total |

What will be the result of the query below? Explain your answer and provide a version that behaves correctly.

    select case when null = null then 'Yup' else 'Nope' end as Result;
    

View the answer →Hide answer


This query will actually yield “Nope”, seeming to imply that `null` is not equal to itself! The reason for this is that the proper way to compare a value to `null` in SQL is with the `is` operator, not with `=`.

Accordingly, the correct version of the above query that yields the expected result (i.e., “Yup”) would be as follows:

    	select case when null is null then 'Yup' else 'Nope' end as Result;
    

This is because `null` represents an unknown value. If you don’t know the value, you can’t know whether it equals another value, so `= null` is always assumed to be false.


Given the following tables:

    |  4 | triathalon     |  NULL     |
    +----+----------------+-----------+
    

What will be the result of the query below?

    SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)
    

Explain your answer and also provide an alternative version of this query that will avoid the issue that it exposes.

View the answer →Hide answer


Surprisingly, given the sample data provided, the result of this query will be an empty set. The reason for this is as follows: If the set being evaluated by the `SQL NOT IN` condition contains _any_ values that are null, then the outer query here will return an empty set, even if there are many runner ids that match winner_ids in the `races` table.

Knowing this, a query that avoids this issue would be as follows:

    SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races WHERE winner_id IS NOT null)
    

Note, this is assuming the standard SQL behavior that you get without modifying the default `ANSI_NULLS` setting.


Given two tables created and populated as follows:

    CREATE TABLE dbo.envelope(id int, user_id int);
    CREATE TABLE dbo.docs(idnum int, pageseq int, doctext varchar(100));
    
    INSERT INTO dbo.envelope VALUES
      (1,1),
      (2,2),
      (3,3);
    
    INSERT INTO dbo.docs(idnum,pageseq) VALUES
      (1,5),
      (2,6),
      (null,0);
    

What will the result be from the following query:

    UPDATE docs SET doctext=pageseq FROM docs INNER JOIN envelope ON envelope.id=docs.idnum
    WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM dbo.docs
      WHERE id=envelope.id
    );
    

Explain your answer.

View the answer →Hide answer


The result of the query will be as follows:

    idnum  pageseq  doctext
    1      5        5
    2      6        6
    NULL   0        NULL
    

The `EXISTS` clause in the above query is a red herring. It will _always_ be true since `ID` is _not_ a member of `dbo.docs`. As such, it will refer to the `envelope` table comparing itself to itself!

The `idnum` value of `NULL` will not be set since the join of `NULL` will not return a result when attempting a match with any value of `envelope`.


What is wrong with this SQL query? Correct it so it executes properly.

    SELECT Id, YEAR(BillingDate) AS BillingYear 
    FROM Invoices
    WHERE BillingYear >= 2010;
    

View the answer →Hide answer


The expression BillingYear in the WHERE clause is invalid. Even though it is defined as an alias in the SELECT phrase, which appears before the WHERE phrase, the logical processing order of the phrases of the statement is different from the written order. Most programmers are accustomed to code statements being processed generally top-to-bottom or left-to-right, but T-SQL processes phrases in a different order.

The correct query should be:

    SELECT Id, YEAR(BillingDate) AS BillingYear
    FROM Invoices
    WHERE YEAR(BillingDate) >= 2010;
    


Given these contents of the Customers table:

    Id	Name			ReferredBy
    1	John Doe		NULL
    2	Jane Smith		NULL
    3	Anne Jenkins		2
    4	Eric Branford		NULL
    5	Pat Richards		1
    6	Alice Barnes		2
    

Here is a query written to return the list of customers not referred by Jane Smith:

    SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy <> 2;
    

What will be the result of the query? Why? What would be a better way to write it?

View the answer →Hide answer


Although there are 4 customers not referred by Jane Smith (including Jane Smith herself), the query will only return one: Pat Richards. All the customers who were referred by nobody at all (and therefore have NULL in their ReferredBy column) don’t show up. But certainly those customers weren’t referred by Jane Smith, and certainly NULL is not equal to 2, so why didn’t they show up?

SQL Server uses three-valued logic, which can be troublesome for programmers accustomed to the more satisfying two-valued logic (TRUE or FALSE) most programming languages use. In most languages, if you were presented with two predicates: ReferredBy = 2 and ReferredBy <> 2, you would expect one of them to be true and one of them to be false, given the same value of ReferredBy. In SQL Server, however, if ReferredBy is NULL, neither of them are true and neither of them are false. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value in three-valued logic: UNKNOWN.

The query should be written in one of two ways:

    SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy IS NULL OR ReferredBy <> 2
    

…or:

    SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ISNULL(ReferredBy, 0) <> 2; -- (Or COALESCE() )
    

Watch out for the following, though!

    SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy = NULL OR ReferredBy <> 2
    

This will return the same faulty set as the original. Why? We already covered that: Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value in the three-valued logic: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why SQL Server provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL. Those particular operators will always evaluate to true or false.

Even if a candidate doesn’t have a great amount of experience with SQL Server, diving into the intricacies of three-valued logic in general can give a good indication of whether they have the ability learn it quickly or whether they will struggle with it.


Considering the database schema displayed in the SQLServer-style diagram below, write a SQL query to return a list of all the invoices. For each invoice, show the Invoice ID, the billing date, the customer’s name, and the name of the customer who referred that customer (if any). The list should be ordered by billing date.

![](https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/669/toptal-blog-image-1416228086286.png)

View the answer →Hide answer


    SELECT i.Id, i.BillingDate, c.Name, r.Name AS ReferredByName
    FROM Invoices i
     JOIN Customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.Id
     LEFT JOIN Customers r ON c.ReferredBy = r.Id
    ORDER BY i.BillingDate;
    

This question simply tests the candidate’s ability take a plain-English requirement and write a corresponding SQL query. There is nothing tricky in this one, it just covers the basics:

*   Did the candidate remember to use a LEFT JOIN instead of an inner JOIN when joining the customer table for the referring customer name? If not, any invoices by customers not referred by somebody will be left out altogether.
    
*   Did the candidate alias the tables in the JOIN? Most experienced T-SQL programmers always do this, because repeating the full table name each time it needs to be referenced gets tedious quickly. In this case, the query would actually break if at least the Customer table wasn’t aliased, because it is referenced twice in different contexts (once as the table which contains the name of the invoiced customer, and once as the table which contains the name of the referring customer).
    
*   Did the candidate disambiguate the Id and Name columns in the SELECT? Again, this is something most experienced programmers do automatically, whether or not there would be a conflict. And again, in this case there would be a conflict, so the query would break if the candidate neglected to do so.
    

Note that this query will not return Invoices that do not have an associated Customer. This may be the correct behavior for most cases (e.g., it is guaranteed that every Invoice is associated with a Customer, or unmatched Invoices are not of interest). However, in order to guarantee that all Invoices are returned no matter what, the Invoices table should be joined with Customers using LEFT JOIN:

    SELECT i.Id, i.BillingDate, c.Name, r.Name AS ReferredByName
    FROM Invoices i
     LEFT JOIN Customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.Id
     LEFT JOIN Customers r ON c.ReferredBy = r.Id
    ORDER BY i.BillingDate;
    


Assume a schema of `Emp ( Id, Name, DeptId ) , Dept ( Id, Name)`.

If there are 10 records in the `Emp` table and 5 records in the `Dept` table, how many rows will be displayed in the result of the following SQL query:

    Select * From Emp, Dept
    

Explain your answer.

The query will result in 50 rows as a “cartesian product” or “cross join”, which is the default whenever the ‘where’ clause is omitted.


Given a table SALARIES, such as the one below, that has `m = male` and `f = female` values. Swap all `f` and `m` values (i.e., change all `f` values to `m` and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.

    Id  Name  Sex  Salary
    1   A     m    2500
    2   B     f    1500

Given two tables created as follows

    create table test_a(id numeric);
    
    create table test_b(id numeric);
    
    insert into test_a(id) values
      (10),
      (20),
      (30),
      (40),
      (50);
    
    insert into test_b(id) values
      (10),
      (30),
      (50);
    

Write a query to fetch values in table `test_a` that are and not in `test_b` **without** using the NOT keyword.

Note, Oracle does not support the above `INSERT` syntax, so you would need this instead:

    insert into test_a(id) values (10);
    insert into test_a(id) values (20);
    insert into test_a(id) values (30);
    insert into test_a(id) values (40);
    insert into test_a(id) values (50);
    insert into test_b(id) values (10);
    insert into test_b(id) values (30);
    insert into test_b(id) values (50);

In SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, this can be done using the [`except`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_operations_(SQL)#EXCEPT_operator) keyword as follows:

    select * from test_a
    except
    select * from test_b;
    

In Oracle, the [`minus`](http://www.techonthenet.com/sql/minus.php) keyword is used instead. Note that if there are multiple columns, say ID and Name, the column should be explicitly stated in Oracle queries: `Select ID from test_a minus select ID from test_b`

MySQL does not support the `except` function. However, there is a standard SQL solution that works in all of the above engines, including MySQL:

    select a.id
    from test_a a
    left join test_b b on a.id = b.id
    where b.id is null;
    


Given a table `TBL` with a field `Nmbr` that has rows with the following values:

Write a query to add 2 where `Nmbr` is 0 and add 3 where `Nmbr` is 1.

Write a SQL query to find the 10th highest employee salary from an `Employee` table. Explain your answer.

(Note: You may assume that there are at least 10 records in the `Employee` table.)

View the answer →Hide answer


This can be done as follows:

    SELECT TOP (1) Salary FROM
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT TOP (10) Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC
    ) AS Emp ORDER BY Salary
    

This works as follows:

First, the `SELECT DISTINCT TOP (10) Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC` query will select the top 10 salaried employees in the table. However, those salaries will be listed in _descending_ order. That was necessary for the first query to work, but now picking the top 1 from that list will give you the _highest_ salary not the the _10th highest_ salary.

Therefore, the second query reorders the 10 records in _ascending_ order (which the default sort order) and _then_ selects the top record (which will now be the lowest of those 10 salaries).

Not all databases support the `TOP` keyword. For example, MySQL and PostreSQL use the `LIMIT` keyword, as follows:

    SELECT Salary FROM
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 10
    ) AS Emp ORDER BY Salary LIMIT 1;
    

Or even more concisely, in MySQL this can be:

    SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 9,1;
    

And in PostgreSQL this can be:

    SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 9;
    


Write a SQL query using `UNION ALL` (**not** `UNION`) that uses the `WHERE` clause to eliminate duplicates. Why might you want to do this?

View the answer →Hide answer


You can avoid duplicates using `UNION ALL` and still run much faster than `UNION DISTINCT` (which is actually same as UNION) by running a query like this:

    SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE a=X UNION ALL SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE b=Y AND a!=X
    

The key is the `AND a!=X` part. This gives you the benefits of the `UNION` (a.k.a., `UNION DISTINCT`) command, while avoiding much of its performance hit.

What is an execution plan? When would you use it? How would you view the execution plan?

View the answer →Hide answer


An execution plan is basically a road map that graphically or textually shows the data retrieval methods chosen by the SQL server’s query optimizer for a stored procedure or ad hoc query. Execution plans are very useful for helping a developer understand and analyze the performance characteristics of a query or stored procedure, since the plan is used to execute the query or stored procedure.

In many SQL systems, a textual execution plan can be obtained using a keyword such as `EXPLAIN`, and visual representations can often be obtained as well. In Microsoft SQL Server, the Query Analyzer has an option called “Show Execution Plan” (located on the Query drop down menu). If this option is turned on, it will display query execution plans in a separate window when a query is run.


List and explain each of the ACID properties that collectively guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

View the answer →Hide answer


**ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. They are defined as follows:

*   **Atomicity.** Atomicity requires that each transaction be “all or nothing”: if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes.
*   **Consistency.** The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof.
*   **Isolation.** The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other. Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending on concurrency control method (i.e. if it uses strict - as opposed to relaxed - serializability), the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.
*   **Durability.** Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.

What are the `NVL` and the `NVL2` functions in SQL? How do they differ?

View the answer →Hide answer


Both the `NVL(exp1, exp2)` and `NVL2(exp1, exp2, exp3)` functions check the value `exp1` to see if it is null.

With the `NVL(exp1, exp2)` function, if `exp1` is _not_ null, then the value of `exp1` is returned; otherwise, the value of `exp2` is returned, but case to the same data type as that of `exp1`.

With the `NVL2(exp1, exp2, exp3)` function, if `exp1` is _not_ null, then `exp2` is returned; otherwise, the value of `exp3` is returned.


What is the difference between the `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` functions? Provide an example.

View the answer →Hide answer


The _only_ difference between the `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` functions is in cases where there is a “tie”; i.e., in cases where multiple values in a set have the same ranking. In such cases, `RANK()` will assign non-consecutive “ranks” to the values in the set (resulting in gaps between the integer ranking values when there is a tie), whereas `DENSE_RANK()` will assign consecutive ranks to the values in the set (so there will be no gaps between the integer ranking values in the case of a tie).

For example, consider the set `{25, 25, 50, 75, 75, 100}`. For such a set, `RANK()` will return `{1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6}` (note that the values 2 and 5 are skipped), whereas `DENSE_RANK()` will return `{1,1,2,3,3,4}`.


What is the difference between the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses?

View the answer →Hide answer


When `GROUP BY` is not used, the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses are essentially equivalent.

However, when `GROUP BY` **is** used:

*   The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records from a result. The filtering occurs before any groupings are made.
*   The `HAVING` clause is used to filter values from a group (i.e., to check conditions after aggregation into groups has been performed).


Suppose we have a `Customer` table containing the following data:

    CustomerID  CustomerName
    1           Prashant Kaurav
    2           Ashish Jha
    3           Ankit Varma
    4           Vineet Kumar
    5           Rahul Kumar
    

Write a single SQL statement to concatenate all the customer names into the following single semicolon-separated string:

    Prashant Kaurav; Ashish Jha; Ankit Varma; Vineet Kumar; Rahul Kumar
    

View the answer →Hide answer


    SELECT CustomerName+ '; ' 
    From Customer
    For XML PATH('')
    

This is close, but will have an undesired trailing `;`. One way of fixing that could be:

    SELECT top 1
    LTRIM(STUFF((SELECT &#39;; &#39; + c1.CustomerName FROM Customer c1 FOR XML PATH (&#39;&#39;)), 1, 1,&#39;&#39;)) as SSV
    from Customer c2;
    

In PostgreSQL one can also use this syntax to achieve the fully correct result:

    SELECT array_to_string(array_agg(CustomerName), '; '::text) 
    FROM Customer
    


Given a table `Employee` having columns `empName` and `empId`, what will be the result of the SQL query below?

    select empName from Employee order by 2 desc;
    

View the answer →Hide answer


“Order by 2” is only valid when there are at least two columns being used in select statement. However, in this query, even though the `Employee` table has 2 columns, the query is only selecting 1 column name, so “Order by 2” will cause the statement to throw an error while executing the above sql query.


What will be the output of the below query, given an Employee table having 10 records?

This query will return 10 records as `TRUNCATE` was executed in the transaction. `TRUNCATE` does not itself keep a log but `BEGIN TRANSACTION` keeps track of the `TRUNCATE` command.

What is the difference between `char` and `varchar2`?

View the answer →Hide answer

![answer badge](https://bs-assets.toptal.io/blackfish-assets/public/shared/images/icons/answer_badge_dc4c6f.png)

When stored in a database, `varchar2` uses only the allocated space. E.g. if you have a `varchar2(1999)` and put 50 bytes in the table, it will use 52 bytes.

But when stored in a database, `char` always uses the maximum length and is blank-padded. E.g. if you have `char(1999)` and put 50 bytes in the table, it will consume 2000 bytes.

`IN`:

*   Works on List result set
*   Doesn’t work on subqueries resulting in Virtual tables with multiple columns
*   Compares every value in the result list
*   Performance is comparatively SLOW for larger resultset of subquery

`EXISTS`:

*   Works on Virtual tables
*   Is used with co-related queries
*   Exits comparison when match is found
*   Performance is comparatively FAST for larger resultset of subquery

    SELECT salary from Employee order by salary DESC LIMIT 2,1
    

This will give the third-highest salary from the Employee table. Accordingly we can find out Nth salary using `LIMIT (N-1),1`.

But MS SQL Server doesn’t support that syntax, so in that case:

    SELECT salary from Employee order by salary DESC
    OFFSET 2 ROWS
    FETCH NEXT 1 ROW ONLY
    

`OFFSET`’s parameter corresponds to the `(N-1)` above.
